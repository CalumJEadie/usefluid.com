<h1>About</h1>

<p><a href="http://andrewratomski.com">Andrew</a> and <a href="http://calumjeadie.com">Calum</a> make up Brinian. We're building collaboration tools for visual thinkers.</p>

<p>We use sketches to communicate every day. Andrew understands both sides of the coin; he read English at St Andrews and has worked as a graphic designer. Calum studied Computer Science at Cambridge, where he created a <a href="https://github.com/CalumJEadie/video-processing-language-for-the-raspberry-pi">Visual Programming Language for the Raspberry Pi</a>.</p>

<p>We share a deep empathy for how all kinds of people interact with technology and enthusiasm for attacking user experience problems with design thinking.</p>
